# URDF_models

### Overview
This repository is a comprehensive collection of over 100 URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) models, specifically designed for use with Pybullet. 
It serves as a valuable resource for researchers, developers, and hobbyists in the field of robotics and simulation.

### Model Details
Each model in this repository is accompanied by detailed information to facilitate its use and integration. The following table outlines key attributes for each model:
