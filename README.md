# URDF_models

This repository contains a collection of URDF models for use with Pybullet, and is a fork of the [pybullet-URDF-models](https://github.com/ChenEating716/pybullet-URDF-models) project. We would like to extend our gratitude to the author for their hard work. Each model includes a license_info.txt file. This repository is constantly updated and improved.ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
