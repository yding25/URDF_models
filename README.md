# URDF_models

### This repository contains a collection of over 100 URDF models for use with Pybullet. 

### To facilitate the use of this database, I provide some extra information as shown in the Excel table below.

- **subfolder_name**: name of the folder where each URDF model is stored. 

- **relative_path**: path of each URDF model

- **size_x, size_y, size_z**: dimensions of each URDF model 

- **object_name**: name of each URDF model, which is the same as **subfolder_name**. 

- **euler_x, euler_y, euler_z**: recommended Euler angles for loading the items, which can prevent unreasonable scenes due to improper angles of the items, such as a chair being tilted. 

- **object_description**: a human-annotated description of each URDF model 

### Note that Some of the models are sourced from the [pybullet-URDF-models](https://github.com/ChenEating716/pybullet-URDF-models) project

- we would like to extend our gratitude to the author for their hard work. 

- This repository is constantly updated and improved.ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª
